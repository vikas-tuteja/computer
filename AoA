1. An abstract data type (ADT), is a logical description of how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented. This means that we are concerned only with what the data is representing and not with how it will eventually be constructed. By providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an encapsulation around the data. The idea is that by encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the user’s view. This is called information hiding.

2.AoA:
- algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions
- the parameter n is often referred to as the “size of the problem,” 
- efficiency
- use of resources 1) memory 2) time
- code readability

Performance:
Big-O Notation
Order of magnitude: O(f(n))
1, n, log n, n log n, n^2, n^3, 2^n

dict most ops O(1) while lists most are O(n) except pop, append, index and assignment
